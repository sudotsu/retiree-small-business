## 13) Staffing & scheduling (lean but real)

**Roles:**

- **Lead Concierge (0.5 FTE to start):** runs SOPs, writes one‑pagers, hosts 60% of labs.
- **TA / Moderator (0.25 FTE):** co‑hosts labs, monitors group, answers email.
- **Instructor (Chaz) cameos:** drop‑in 10 minutes at select labs the first 2 weeks—trust rocket fuel.

**Weekly rhythm (Modules 0–3):**

- Labs daily (Mon–Fri): 2 time zones (e.g., 11am & 3pm local).
- Office Hours: 1x/week.
- 1:1 callbacks: 1–2 hours/day block.

**Training:** shadow 3 labs; do 3 labs supervised; then solo. One SOP binder, one emergency contact sheet.

- **FRT (first response time)** : target < 1 business day.
- **Time to first publish** (site) and **time to first test payment** (median days).

marketing-assets-1

9. Record short welcome video for Module 0 + group. SAP_Module-00_TBD-Title_v1
10. Recruit 5 beta retirees for social proof (60–75). Capture one 30‑sec clip each by end of Week B.

## 16) Exactly where this leans on your course materials (so nothing fights the curriculum)

- **Module 0** (Orientation) is where we **launch support** : welcome, readiness quiz, and a clear “how to get help” banner. SAP_Module-00_TBD-Title_v1
- **Essentials** already pushes quick wins—our labs ensure the "vital signs" don't stall for tech (printing worksheets; basic site; payments; scheduling). KORB ESSENTIALS
- **Mastery Modules 1–3** is about defaults, big picture, and time. We add email polish, domain/site, payments, and schedule blocks right where they belong—so Module 4 (Marketing 5 Ps) has a basic funnel to point at, and later **Module 6 (Lead Gen)** has a place to send people. Korb weeks 1-4

  Korb weeks 5-8

- **Marketing assets + quizzes** now actively funnel to labs for hands‑on help where appropriate. marketing-assets-1

## 17) What’s not in here on purpose

- No “clever tech hacks,” no jargon, no bots. Human help, plain words, big type. If it feels complicated, we cut it or we do it with them.
