## THE CRITICAL DECISION: WordPress.com vs Self-Hosted WordPress.org

### Why NOT WordPress.com:
Your course requires advanced LMS capabilities that WordPress.com simply cannot provide:

❌ NO plugin installation (even on Business plan $25/month)
❌ Cannot install LearnDash, LifterLMS, or Tutor LMS  
❌ No advanced quiz tracking and prerequisites
❌ No way to implement your Mastery vs Essentials track branching
❌ Limited course management and student analytics
❌ Cannot customize for your specific workflow

**WordPress.com is designed for blogs, not comprehensive courses.**

### Solution: Migrate to Self-Hosted WordPress.org + LearnDash

This gives you:
✅ Full control over course structure and student experience
✅ Advanced quiz and progress tracking
✅ Ability to implement both course tracks seamlessly
✅ Complete email automation integration
✅ Custom branding and design flexibility
✅ Cost-effective: $15-30/month hosting + $199/year LearnDash = $365-559/year

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Your course is comprehensive and world-class. Your students deserve infrastructure that matches that quality.

WordPress.com can't deliver that. Self-hosted WordPress with LearnDash absolutely can—at a fraction of the cost of Kajabi or Teachable.

You have everything you need to build something truly special.

**Start with Cloudways hosting. Start with LearnDash. Your students will feel the difference.**
