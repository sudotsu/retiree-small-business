## Case Vignettes

### Mary’s Tutoring Triumph
Mary, a retired high-school English teacher, found joy in tutoring again. She started by offering free sessions to neighborhood kids who needed help with grammar and writing. Word spread quickly, and soon Mary had a steady roster of students preparing for college entrance exams. Working just eight hours a week from her dining room table and occasionally via Zoom, she earns extra income while maintaining flexibility. Mary’s best marketing tool is handwritten thank-you notes that parents share at PTA meetings. Her success proves that passion and personal connections can launch a fulfilling retiree business.

### John’s Blossoming Garden Service
John spent thirty-five years as a corporate accountant before retiring. His true passion has always been gardening. After taking a Master Gardener course through his local university extension, he launched a part-time garden-care service. John targets busy professionals and senior neighbors who love beautiful yards but lack the time or physical ability to maintain them. He invests in quality tools and offers a free first consultation to discuss clients’ plant preferences. During peak seasons, John works about twelve hours a week. His clients rave about his patience and knowledge, often referring him to their friends.

### Evelyn’s Digital Guide to Downsizing
