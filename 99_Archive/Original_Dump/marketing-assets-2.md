Introduction from Chaz

Hello, and welcome!
I’m Chaz, your guide for the Retiree Small Business Course. Over the years, I’ve seen countless friends and clients transform their retirement by starting small, meaningful businesses. They didn’t have fancy degrees or investors — they had passion, experience and a desire to stay purposeful. In this quick guide, I’ll share five low‑risk ideas you can start within the next month. These suggestions let you dip your toe into entrepreneurship without risking your savings. Each idea is flexible, fits into a retiree’s schedule and can grow at your pace. Let’s explore what’s possible!

Five Ideas to Get You Started

Life Experience Coaching — Use your professional expertise or life lessons to coach others (for example, tutoring new retirees on budgeting or mentoring young professionals). Start by outlining your specialty, then offer one‑hour sessions locally or via video call. Use community bulletin boards and social media to find clients. You need nothing more than a phone and your wisdom.

Crafts and Handmade Goods — Do you knit, sew, paint or woodwork? Create small batches of items and sell them on local marketplaces or at community fairs. Begin by making a few pieces and photographing them. List them on a platform like Etsy or join a local craft fair. Keep overhead low by using materials you already have.

Pet Care Services — Offer dog walking, pet sitting or pet grooming in your neighborhood. Many people travel or work long hours and need trusted pet care. Introduce yourself to neighbors, post flyers at community centers and set your rates clearly. You’ll enjoy exercise, fresh air and furry companions.

Home Organization and Downsizing Help — Retirees often downsize; young families need help decluttering. If you enjoy creating order, offer to sort, organize and clear out rooms or entire homes. Start by volunteering for a friend, take before‑and‑after photos and build trust through referrals. Supplies are minimal — labels, boxes and your ability to keep things moving.

Digital Services for Seniors — Many older adults are intimidated by technology. If you’re comfortable with computers, offer services such as teaching basic email use, setting up tablets or creating photo books. Advertise through libraries, community centers or online groups. Charge by the hour and be patient; your help is invaluable.

One‑Page Checklist: Launch Your Idea

Print this checklist or fill it out on your computer — it’s a single page you can keep on your desk. For each idea you’re interested in, check off the boxes as you move forward.

Identify Your Skills and Interests — Make a short list of things you enjoy and are good at.

Choose One Idea — Pick one idea from this guide that excites you.

Describe Your First Service/Product — Write one sentence about what you will offer.

Name Your First Customer — Think of one person who could use this service or product.

Set a Start Date — Circle a date within the next two weeks to take your first action.

Tell a Friend — Share your goal with a friend or family member to create accountability.

Take the First Step — Whether it’s creating a flyer, posting on social media or buying supplies, do one small thing to move forward.

Track Your Progress — Use the space below to note what you’ve done.

Once you’ve tried an idea, revisit this checklist to refine and expand.
