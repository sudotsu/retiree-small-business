## 💡 Lesson Overview

You’ve mapped your attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and people.

You’ve seen how they help and hurt your progress.

Now, it’s time to **update those settings and build your personal operating system** — complete with guardrails that keep your effort steady and your energy protected.

By the end of this lesson you’ll:

* Rewrite your outdated attitudes, beliefs, and motivations into supportive versions.
* Build a simple set of guardrails that keep you from over-giving, over-researching, or over-committing.
* Prepare to evaluate your full business readiness in the next lesson’s **Fit Check.**

## 🧠 Part 1 – Why Rewriting Matters

Your beliefs and habits form an invisible “auto-pilot.”

Unless you adjust them, they’ll keep steering your business the same direction they steered your career.

Rewriting defaults doesn’t mean denying who you are; it means giving your better instincts the microphone.

**Example 1 – Belief Shift**

> Old default → “Selling is pushy.”
>
> New default → “Selling is helping someone make a good decision.”

**Example 2 – Attitude Shift**

> Old default → “I’m too old to learn tech.”
>
> New default → “I can learn one simple tool at a time.”

Each rewrite opens a little more room for growth.

## ✏️ Exercise 1 – Rewrite Your Defaults Map V2

Pull out the four lists you built in Lesson 1.2 and the plus/minus tables from 1.3.

We’re going to upgrade each item.

| Category   | Old Default Statement                       | New Default (Rewrite)                               | Change Symbol ⭐ |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Attitude   | “I avoid conflict.”                       | “I handle disagreement with respect and clarity.” | ⭐               |
| Belief     | “Money is stressful.”                     | “Money is a tool I can learn to use.”             | ⭐               |
| Motivation | “Recognition drives me.”                  | “I value recognition and impact equally.”         | ⭐               |
| People     | “My family doesn’t understand business.” | “I’ll explain my goals so they can support me.”  | ⭐               |

✅ Star every rewrite you make.

Count your stars when done — that’s how many internal updates you’ve already made.

> 💬 Tip: Say each new statement out loud. Hearing yourself say “I can” and “I will” trains your mind to accept it as real.

## 🧭 Part 2 – Building Your Guardrails

A guardrail is a short, plain promise that keeps your good traits from running off the road.

They prevent over-giving, burnout, or decision drift.

| Pattern                          | New Guardrail                                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| “I say yes too fast.”          | “I wait 24 hours before adding new projects.”          |
| “I avoid money conversations.” | “I review my numbers every Friday at 10 a.m.”          |
| “I over-research everything.”  | “I test one tiny idea per week before more reading.”   |
| “I over-help clients.”         | “15 minutes free then a paid plan or graceful ‘no.’” |

Write three of your own:

1. **Time Guardrail** → _____
2. **Money Guardrail** → _____
3. **Energy Guardrail** → _____

Pin them above your workspace.

## 📚 Mini-Story – Mary and the Boundary Rewrite

Mary was a retired teacher turned tutor. Her belief was “If I charge less, more kids get help.” It was noble—but unsustainable.

Her rewrite became “If I charge fairly, I can serve more students for longer.”

She added a guardrail: “No discounts without 24 hours to think.”

Within a month, she was booked solid and less stressed.

Boundaries didn’t limit her—they kept her mission alive.

## ✏️ Exercise 2 – Guardrails for Your Top Patterns

Take the three “flip” statements from Lesson 1.3 and turn each into a guardrail.

1️⃣ Write the old pattern.

2️⃣ Write the new intention.

3️⃣ Describe a visible behavior that keeps it in bounds.

Example:

* Old Pattern: “I feel guilty saying no.”
* Intention: “Every no protects a yes that matters.”
* Behavior: “I pause and say, ‘Let me check my schedule,’ before agreeing to anything.”

Do this for each pattern and write them on sticky notes where you work.

## 💬 Journal Prompts

1. Which rewrite feels most liberating?
2. Which guardrail will be hardest to keep—and why is it worth it anyway?
3. What’s one way you can remind yourself to honor these new defaults daily?
4. If a friend saw your new guardrails, what might they say about the change in you?

Write a full paragraph for each question. Depth creates retention.

## 🤝 Community Prompt

Post in the group:

> “I rewrote my default about _____ from _____ to _____ and added this guardrail: _____.”

Read three others and leave a short comment or emoji reaction.

This is how you normalize change in your cohort.

## 🧩 Part 3 – Keeping Your Rewrites Alive

Rewrites fade without reinforcement. Here’s how to keep them alive:

1️⃣  **Say them out loud daily** —voice builds memory.

2️⃣ **Pair each rewrite with an action.**

 Example: “Money is a tool” → 10-minute Friday budget review.

3️⃣ **Track visible wins** in your Success Jar (Module 0 habit).

4️⃣ **Review monthly.** Add dates to your planner to refresh guardrails.
