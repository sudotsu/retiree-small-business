### 💡 Lesson Overview

Every business decision begins long before spreadsheets and marketing plans.

It begins in your *defaults* — the invisible rules that have guided every “yes” and “no” you’ve made for decades.

This lesson uncovers those rules so your future business choices align with who you are rather than working against you.

Honesty > Speed > Perfection.

### 🧭 Part 1 — The Story Behind Your Defaults

Think of a time you made a big life choice — buying a home, changing jobs, moving states, raising kids, retiring.

You probably didn’t flip a coin.

You weighed  *comfort vs risk* ,  *security vs freedom* ,  *logic vs gut* .

That weighing process is your  **decision driver system** .

Most of us have never written ours down; we just assume it works.

But if you want a calm, sustainable business in retirement, it’s time to look under the hood.

### ✏️ Exercise 1 — Decision Influences Drill

**Goal:** Identify the forces that shape your everyday choices.

1. Set a timer for 5 minutes. List **21 influences** that guide your daily decisions.

   Include people, values, habits, or fears.

   *(Examples: Spouse’s opinion, security, faith, fear of failure, desire to help others.)*
2. Cross out five that matter least today.
3. Circle your **Top 7.**
4. Star the **Top 3** that most affect major choices.
5. Write a sentence for each star: “When I make big decisions, this influence shows up by _____.”

### 📚 Mini-Story: Evelyn’s “Safety First” Driver

Evelyn spent 40 years in corporate HR. Her top driver was  **security** . When she retired, that same driver nearly stopped her from starting a downsizing consulting service. Once she recognized security as her dominant influence, she adjusted the risk: she launched with two clients per month instead of ten. Security stayed honored, progress happened anyway. That’s fit. That’s awareness.KORB ESSENTIALS

### ✏️ Exercise 2 — Decision Replay (Activity)

Pick **one major decision** from your past 10 years that turned out well and one that didn’t.

Use this two-column worksheet:

| Past Decision    | Key Influences In Play | Outcome / Lesson Learned       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Success Example  | (List Top 3 drivers)   | (Summarize why it worked)      |
| Struggle Example | (List Top 3 drivers)   | (Summarize what you’d adjust) |

Write three sentences on what this comparison shows you about your defaults in action.

---

### 💬 Reflection Prompts

1. Which of my decision drivers shows up in both good and bad decisions?
2. How often does fear disguise itself as “being realistic”?
3. Who around me influences decisions the most — and do they see my potential or my limitations?
4. What’s one small change in my daily decision routine that could help me feel more in control?
5. If a friend asked how I decide things, what would I say my process is?

Write in complete sentences to lock in clarity.

---

### 🤝 Community Prompt

Post one of your Top 3 drivers in the community space with a sentence:

> “This driver has helped me because ____, but I plan to watch for ____.”

Respond to two others with encouragement or questions like, “How does that show up in your day-to-day?”

---

### 🧩 Part 2 — Pattern Recognition

Look at your Top 3 and the Replay Exercise.

Do you see patterns between why things worked and why they didn’t?

Patterns are the real curriculum of this course.

By the time you finish the Mastery track, your guardrails, business model, and schedule will all grow from what you learn here.
