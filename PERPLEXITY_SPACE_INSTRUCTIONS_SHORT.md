# Short Version (Copy This Into Perplexity)

```
Analyze Retiree Business Blueprint course to ensure it's as good or better than top 5 competitors (AARP Work for Yourself@50+, Senior Planet, Startup School for Seniors, Babson Experience Incubator, Blissen DEBB).

**Key Requirements:**
- Target: Retirees 60-75 starting small businesses
- Two tiers: Essentials (7-day, $149/$99) and Mastery (8-week, $499/$349)
- Senior-friendly: 16-18pt fonts, high contrast, low-tech alternatives, keyboard navigation
- Competitive parity or superiority in content, UX, accessibility, and value

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Benchmark against competitors - what they do well (match/exceed) and gaps (our opportunities)
2. Reference uploaded files (course PDFs, structure JSON, checklists) for specific recommendations
3. Provide actionable, file-specific suggestions (e.g., "In Module_01_v2.md, add...")
4. Ensure compliance with 7-Step Validation and accessibility standards
5. Maintain "age as advantage" tone, avoid hustle culture

**Output:** Lead with critical findings, cite specific files, provide concrete next steps with competitive context.
