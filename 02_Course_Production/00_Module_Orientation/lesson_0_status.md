🧭 Next Step Recommendation

Since Module 0 and Module 1 (Lessons 1.1 through 1.5) are now fully built, you’re ready to either:

✅ Move on to Module 2 content creation

📦 Have me build out the PDF student workbook for Module 0 or Module 1 (includes journal space, checklists, etc.)

📺 Script or outline videos (e.g. Module 2 intro or walkthroughs)

What do you want next: Module 2 lesson builds, Module 0/1 workbook generation, or something else?
