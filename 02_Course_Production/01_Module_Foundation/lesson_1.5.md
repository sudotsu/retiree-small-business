## 💡 Lesson Overview

Over the past four lessons, you’ve examined what drives your decisions (1.1), mapped your defaults (1.2), balanced their positives and negatives (1.3), and rewritten them with guardrails (1.4).

Now you’ll pull everything together to decide whether _right now_ is your time to move forward.

This lesson helps you make that decision intentionally—based on readiness, not emotion.

You’ll use the **Traffic-Light Fit System** to discover whether your current reality supports launching or whether you should pause and strengthen foundations first.

## 🧠 Part 1 – Why Fit Matters

A “fit” business fits _you._

It works with your energy, your health, your finances, your family rhythm, and your temperament.

It challenges you—but it doesn’t chew you up.

When a business doesn’t fit, even good ideas feel heavy.

When it fits, the same work feels purposeful.

**Fit** means congruence—your values, resources, and time all pointing in one direction.

Today you’ll measure that alignment.

## ✏️ Exercise 1 – Traffic-Light Readiness Check

Use your workbook or print the “Fit Assessment Worksheet.”

For each area below, mark **Green (Ready)** , **Yellow (Caution)** , or **Red (Not Yet)** and write short notes.

| Category               | Questions to Ask Yourself                                                  | Color (G/Y/R) | Notes |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **Time & Energy**      | Do I have 5 hours per week I can protect consistently?                     |               |       |
| **Money & Resources**  | Can I set aside a small budget ($50–$500) to test ideas without stress?    |               |       |
| **Support Network**    | Do I have at least one encourager and one accountability partner?          |               |       |
| **Mindset**            | Am I curious and willing to learn through mistakes?                        |               |       |
| **Technology Comfort** | Can I use basic email and online tools (or schedule a Tech Concierge lab)? |               |       |
| **Risk Tolerance**     | When plans change, do I adapt or freeze?                                   |               |       |
| **Motivation**         | What’s stronger right now—fear of failure or desire for purpose?           |               |       |

After you mark each, step back and look at the pattern—not as “grades,” but as signals.

## 🔍 Part 2 – Understanding Your Result

### 🟢 Green – GO Forward

You’re ready to move into **Module 2 (Big Picture)** .

Keep your guardrails from Lesson 1.4 visible and begin linking goals to life priorities.

_Next action:_ Schedule your first **First $100 Challenge** —a small, 30-day goal to earn your first business dollars.

---

### 🟡 Yellow – GO With Guardrails

You’re close. A few pieces need reinforcement.

Maybe your schedule is tight or your tech comfort low.

Use the “Proceed Safely When…” statements below.

Write 3 sentences that begin with:

> “I can proceed safely when …”

Examples:

- “I can proceed safely when I complete one Setup Lab.”
- “I can proceed safely when I limit business hours to one per day.”
- “I can proceed safely when my budget spreadsheet is updated.”

Revisit these each week to track progress.

---

### 🔴 Red – Not Yet

This isn’t a stop sign —it’s a detour for safety.

If health, family care, or finances need attention, honor that.

Move into the **Essentials Track** instead of the full Mastery pace.

Complete your **Pause Plan:**

- “What needs to change before I resume?”
- “What support can I build during the pause?”
- “When will I review this decision?” (set a calendar reminder in 60 days).

Even a pause is momentum—it prevents costly burnout later.

## 🧩 Part 3 – Real Stories of Fit

**Mary – The Encourager Who Refined Her Fit**

Mary loved helping others and wanted to coach new retirees, but she rated herself Yellow for time and money.

Her guardrail was “three clients maximum until expenses steady.”

Within six months she had steady referrals and breathing room.

**Evelyn – The Planner Who Paused**

Evelyn scored Red for energy while caring for her husband.

She took the Essentials track and used her hour a day to write a downsizing ebook.

When life calmed, she was already earning online without re-starting from scratch.

Their lesson: Fit isn’t about ego—it’s about alignment.

## 🧭 Part 4 – Preparing for Momentum

No matter your Fit color, set a small, visible goal for the next 30 days:

| Fit Color | Next Step                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Green  | Join the “First $100 Challenge.” Start one paid test offer within 30 days.      |
| 🟡 Yellow | Pick one guardrail to strengthen and repeat the Fit Check in 4 weeks.           |
| 🔴 Red    | Take Essentials Lessons 1-3 and book one Tech Concierge lab to reduce barriers. |

Remember — forward is forward, no matter how small the step.
