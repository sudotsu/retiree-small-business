# 🧭 Module 1: Knowing Yourself — Your Foundation & Decision-Making

> “By the end of this module, you’ll understand what drives your choices, identify your natural ‘default settings,’ and decide whether your wiring supports a small-business venture right now.”

## **Lesson 1.1 – What Really Drives Your Decisions**

### 🎯 Goal

Surface the influences that quietly shape how you make choices — so you can build a business that fits _you_ instead of fighting you.

### 🪞 Reflection

Think of your “default settings” the way a computer has factory defaults. They run automatically until you change them.

What’s been running you?

### 🧩 Your Exercise — Decision Influences Drill

1. On a blank page, list **21 things** that influence your decisions — people, values, habits, fears, anything.
2. Cross out 5 that matter least.
3. Circle your **Top 7** .
4. Star the **Top 3** that most affect major life choices.

### 💬 Journal Prompts

- When do those top 3 influences show up most clearly?
- Which of them helps you take smart risks?
- Which one holds you back?

> _Insight to keep:_ Your influences aren’t good or bad — they’re indicators. Knowing them lets you choose your next settings on purpose.

## **Lesson 1.2 – Mapping Your Default Settings**

### 🎯 Goal

Document your attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and people — and evaluate whether they’ll support a small-business life.

### 📘 Four Default Categories

| Category        | Definition                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attitudes**   | Your emotional stance toward challenges (“I can figure this out” vs “I can’t”). |
| **Beliefs**     | Your assumed truths about money, work, and worth.                               |
| **Motivations** | What gets you moving — freedom, security, purpose, recognition.                 |
| **People**      | Those closest to you whose energy affects your choices.                         |
