## 💡 Lesson Overview

By now you’ve (1) identified your decision drivers and (2) mapped your default settings across  **Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivations, and People** .

This lesson is where we get honest and practical: **every default carries a positive and a negative.**

Optimism attracts opportunity—and sometimes underestimates effort.

Caution reduces risk—and sometimes blocks progress.

The aim isn’t to “fix” you; it’s to **balance** you so your strengths work *for* you in business.

Today you’ll:

* run a structured Plus/Minus analysis on each category,
* discover patterns that repeat under pressure,
* translate those patterns into **guardrail ideas** you’ll finalize in Lesson 1.4.

## 🧠 Part 1 — What “Positive vs Negative” Actually Means

In this course, **Positive** doesn’t mean “personality trait that looks nice.” It means the trait  **helps you achieve your business goals** .

**Negative** doesn’t mean “character flaw.” It means the trait  **creates friction for those same goals** —especially when you’re tired, rushed, or under pressure.

**Example:**

* *Attitude:* “I jump in quickly.”
  * **Positive:** You move ideas into action; you test and learn fast.
  * **Negative:** You may skip details and rework things later.
* *Belief:* “If I’m kind, business will come.”
  * **Positive:** You foster trust and loyalty.
  * **Negative:** You may underprice, overgive, and burn out.

This lens keeps you practical. You’re not judging who you are—you’re evaluating how a setting performs inside a business.

## ✏️ Exercise 1 — Plus/Minus Tables (All Four Categories)

**Goal:** Translate your **Default Settings Map V1** (from Lesson 1.2) into a clear view of what helps and what hinders.

Create the following tables (one per category). You can handwrite or use your workbook page.

### A) Attitudes — Plus/Minus

| Attitude           | Positive / Helps Me             | Negative / Hurts Me         | Notes / When It Appears        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| (e.g., Optimistic) | Keeps me resilient with clients | Underestimates time/effort  | Worse when I’m rushed         |
| (e.g., Cautious)   | Prevents costly mistakes        | Misses timely opportunities | Worse when choices feel public |
| (add your own)     |                                 |                             |                                |

### B) Beliefs — Plus/Minus

| Belief                         | Positive / Helps Me | Negative / Hurts Me     | Notes / Origin       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| “Money is stressful.”        | Forces budgeting    | Avoids pricing & offers | Learned from parent? |
| “Good service sells itself.” | Focus on quality    | Avoids outreach         | Former boss?         |
| (add your own)                 |                     |                         |                      |

### C) Motivations — Plus/Minus

| Motivation     | Positive / Helps Me | Negative / Hurts Me    | Notes / Triggers      |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Security       | Consistent habits   | Avoids necessary risks | Seasonal bills        |
| Recognition    | Energizes outreach  | Overpromises to please | Social media feedback |
| (add your own) |                     |                        |                       |

### D) People — Plus/Minus

| Person / Role  | Positive / Helps Me       | Negative / Hurts Me  | Notes / Boundary Needed          |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Spouse         | Encourages routines       | Worries about risk   | Share weekly update              |
| Adult child    | Connects me with contacts | Second-guesses ideas | Ask for cheerleading, not advice |
| (add your own) |                           |                      |                                  |

When finished, **highlight one Positive** you will  **double down on** , and **one Negative** you will **manage** over the next 30 days.

> ✅ **Pro tip:** If you aren’t sure whether something is positive or negative, ask: *“Did this help me move forward last month—or stall me?”* Answer with a specific example.

## 🧭 Part 2 — Pattern-Spotting Under Pressure

Defaults tend to **shift** when we’re under pressure.

That’s why some weeks feel smooth and others spiral.

Scan your tables and ask:

* Which **Negative** appears in more than one category?

  *(e.g., hesitation shows up in Attitudes and Beliefs)*
* Which **Positive** has a clear boundary where it flips?

  *(e.g., generosity flips when you give away client work)*
* When do these flips happen most—mornings, late evenings, after family calls, with money tasks?

**Pattern Example:**

* “My optimism is great for starting, but it flips to underestimation when I skip planning.”
* “My security motive is great for cashflow, but it flips to ‘no marketing’ when bills feel tight.”

You’ll turn these observations into guardrails in Lesson 1.4.

---

## ✏️ Exercise 2 — Flip the Negative (3-Step Reframe)

Choose **one** Negative per category (Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivations, People).

For each, complete the 3-step reframe:

1. **Name it clearly.**
   * *“I avoid prices because talking money makes me tense.”*
2. **Extract its hidden value.**
   * *“I care about fairness and clarity.”*
3. **Redirect it into a specific habit (guardrail idea).**
   * *“I’ll set prices in writing and read them aloud once a week, so I’m ready to say them calmly.”*

Write the reframe for each category (4 total). Keep them short and honest.

## 📘 Mini-Stories (for realism and options)

**Mary — Kindness With a Boundary**

Mary’s belief, *“Kindness builds business,”* was spot on—but she overgave.

Her reframe: *“Kindness includes clarity; I’ll do 15 minutes free, then offer a paid next step.”*

Result: more referrals **and** more paid work.

**John — Caution With a Timer**

John’s caution protected his savings but stalled actions.

His reframe: *“Research for 90 minutes, then one real-world test.”*

Result: consistent learning without endless waiting.

Both built guardrails that **honor** the positive and **limit** the negative.

## 💬 Journal Prompts (write full paragraphs)

1. Which negative pattern costs me the most time, money, or energy—why?
2. Which positive, if I doubled it (with a boundary), would create the most progress?
3. What flips my strengths into stress (times of day, tasks, people)?
4. What 30-day proof would convince me my new reframes are working?

---

## 🤝 Community Prompt

Post this in the discussion area:

> “One positive I’m doubling down on is **[trait]** and the boundary I’ll use is  **[guardrail idea]** .
>
> One negative I’m flipping is **[trait]** and my reframe is  **[short sentence]** .”

Reply to **two peers** with encouragement and one practical suggestion.

This is practice for reflective conversations you’ll have with customers later.

## 🧩 Part 3 — Draft Guardrail Ideas (for 1.4)

Write **at least three** guardrail ideas now (you’ll finalize them next lesson):

* **Time Guardrail:** *“I work **1 hour/day** on business, Mon–Fri, before lunch.”*
* **Money Guardrail:** *“I price with a written sheet; no custom discounts without sleeping on it.”*
* **People Guardrail:** *“I’ll ask X for encouragement and Y for advice; I won’t mix those roles.”*
* **Over-Giving Guardrail:** *“15 minutes free, then a paid path or a clear ‘no.’”*
* **Perfection Guardrail:** *“One pilot with 5 clients beats more research.”*

Keep them short, specific, and visible.
