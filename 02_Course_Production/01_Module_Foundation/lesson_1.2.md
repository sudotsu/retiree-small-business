## 💡 Lesson Overview

Every person has a set of built-in settings that determine how they interpret and react to life.

You explored your decision influences in Lesson 1.1; now it’s time to see  **how those influences live inside four specific areas of your personality** —your Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivations, and People.

This lesson is about noticing patterns, not judging them.

By the end, you’ll have a clear snapshot of how you’re wired right now, so you can decide which settings to keep, which to adjust, and which to silence for the sake of your next chapter.

## 🧠 Part 1 – The Four Default Categories

| **Category**    | **What It Represents**                                             | **Why It Matters in Business Building**                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attitudes**   | Your default emotional stance toward challenge, change, and uncertainty. | Determines whether you see obstacles as data or as threats.               |
| **Beliefs**     | The truths you’ve accepted about money, worth, learning, and age.       | They can fuel action or freeze it; unchecked, they become glass ceilings. |
| **Motivations** | What energizes you to start, persist, or finish.                         | Helps you design a business model that keeps you engaged.                 |
| **People**      | The voices whose opinions matter most to you.                            | Their energy either compounds or cancels your own.                        |

## ✏️ Exercise 1 – Your Default Settings Map V1

**Goal:** Create a written snapshot of your current settings before we start rewriting them.

Use your workbook or a blank sheet.

For each category below, list  **five entries** —no filters, just what’s true right now.

### Attitudes (How you approach challenges)

Examples – Optimistic • Skeptical • Patient • Defensive • Curious • Easily frustrated

Mark each:

✅ Helps me | ⚠️ Sometimes hinders me | ❌ Usually hurts me

### Beliefs (What you assume to be true)

Examples – “Money is hard to earn.”  • “I’m too old to learn tech.”  • “Hard work always wins.”  • “Good service sells itself.”

Mark them ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ and circle any belief you inherited from someone else (parents, bosses, culture).

### Motivations (What moves you to act)

Examples – Security • Purpose • Freedom • Recognition • Helping others • Learning

Star your Top 2 motives for this season of life.

### People (Who shapes your energy and decisions)

List five names or roles (spouse, adult child, best friend, mentor, church group, business buddy).

Mark each: ✅ Supportive | ⚠️ Mixed | ❌ Draining

> 💬 *Tip:* Be honest. This is data, not drama. You’re mapping influence, not assigning blame.

## 🪞 Part 2 – Reading Your Map

Once your lists are filled:

1️⃣ Circle any ✅ items you depend on daily.

2️⃣ Underline ⚠️ items that show up when you’re tired or stressed.

3️⃣ Draw a small ✖️ next to each ❌ that repeats across categories.

These patterns are early warning lights.

If the same frustration shows up under both “Attitudes” and “People,” it’s influencing more of your life than you think.

**Example:**

> Attitude – “I hesitate to try new tech.”
>
> Belief – “I won’t be taken seriously online.”
>
> People – “Friends who roll their eyes at social media.”
>
> Combined → Technology is a pressure point to address early with the Tech Concierge labs.

## ✏️ Exercise 2 – Patterns and Power Sources

Create a simple two-column table in your journal:

| **What Energizes Me (Top 3 ✅)** | **What Drains Me (Top 3 ❌)** |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|                                        |                                     |

Then answer in full sentences:

* How could I design my business so the energizers happen often and the drains rarely?
* What would change if I simply asked the “draining people” to cheer me on instead of advise me?
* Which single ⚠️ item is easiest to improve this month?

Write a short paragraph on each.

## 📘 Mini-Story – John and the Support Test

John’s biggest motivation was  *order* ; he loved lists and control.

But his wife, Elaine, was spontaneous and found his planning obsessive.

When John finally asked her what she needed to feel supportive, she said, “I just want to see you happy doing something you believe in.”

That conversation changed everything — John still planned, but he stopped arguing about her input and started sharing his progress once a week instead of daily debates.

His support network shifted from friction to fuelKORB ESSENTIALS

## 💬 Journal Prompts

1. Which of my four categories is strongest right now, and why?
2. Which category feels most out of alignment with the life I want?
3. What’s one belief I inherited that no longer fits me?
4. Who in my circle seems most invested in my success — and how can I involve them this week?
5. If I could only improve one area (Attitude, Belief, Motivation, People) this month, which would have the biggest impact?

Answer each with at least three sentences; reflection creates traction.
