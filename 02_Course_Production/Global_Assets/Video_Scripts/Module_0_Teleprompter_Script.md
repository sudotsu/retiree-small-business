**Hi, and welcome to the Retiree Business Blueprint.**

[pause 1s]

If you’re watching this,

you’re probably looking for a way

to turn experience into something new —

something that fits your life right now.

[pause 1s]

Maybe you want extra income.

Maybe you’re after more purpose,

structure, or a reason to get up excited again.

Whatever brought you here — I’m glad it did.

[pause 2s]

---

**Here’s what this program is all about.**

[pause 1s]

We help people, fifty and older,

build small, low‑risk businesses

that actually make sense for _their_ lifestyle.

You don’t need a business degree.

You don’t need a pile of money.

You just need an hour a day,

a notebook, and a willingness to act.

[pause 2s]

---

**Two ways to take the course.**

[pause 1s]

There’s a seven‑day version called _Essentials._

That one gives you a quick, powerful overview —

a crash course to test ideas and get moving fast.

Then there’s *Mastery* — an eight‑week,

step‑by‑step version that walks you

from idea to launch — with guidance all the way.

[pause 2s]

If you’re not sure where to start,

take the _Essentials_ path first.

It’ll give you momentum and clarity.

[pause 1s]

---

**Let’s talk expectations.**

[pause 1s]

We keep things simple.

All I ask is this:

give the course one focused hour each day.

No marathons.

No pressure to keep up with anyone.

If you need to miss a day,

there are catch‑up days built right in.

[pause 2s]

This is adult learning — not school.

You can pause, rewind, print everything,

and do it at your own pace.

[pause 1s]

---

**Next — how to get help.**

[pause 1s]

We know technology can feel like a hurdle.

That’s why we built what we call

the _Tech Concierge._

If something isn’t working — printing, login, payments,

whatever — you can request a call or email support

and a real person will help you fix it.

[pause 2s]

We also hold _Live Setup Labs_ during the first few weeks.

They walk you through simple things like

creating your site, setting up email,

and connecting a payment option.

[pause 2s]

Don’t skip these.

They’re part of what makes this program different.

[pause 1s]

---

**You’ll also have a community.**

[pause 1s]

Inside the course,

you’ll see a private group

where you can introduce yourself,

share wins, or ask questions.

Start by posting a quick hello — your name,

where you’re from, and what you hope to get out of this.

[pause 2s]

You’ll be surprised how encouraging

it feels to see other people on the same road.

[pause 1s]

---

**Before we start the lessons,**

there’s a short _Readiness Quiz._

[pause 1s]

It’s not a test — it’s a mirror.

It’ll help you figure out

if now’s the right time for a business

and which path to take first.

[pause 1s]

Right after the quiz,

you’ll get a simple next step —

a page from our _Five‑Day Starter Plan_

that matches your results.

[pause 1s]

You’ll also find a printable workbook

and, if you want inspiration,

a list of _Ten Proven Business Ideas_

that work especially well for retirees.

[pause 2s]

---

**That’s all you need to know to begin.**

[pause 1s]

In the next video,

we’ll walk through the course site together

and show you exactly where to click,

how to download your materials,

and how to post your first hello.

[pause 2s]

For now, grab a notebook,

take a deep breath,

and remember — this isn’t about speed.

It’s about progress you can feel.

[pause 1s]

I’m glad you’re here.

Let’s get started.

**Welcome to the Retiree Business Blueprint.**
