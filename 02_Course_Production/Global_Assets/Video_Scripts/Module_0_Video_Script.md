**[Opening — 0 to 1:00]**

*(camera on Chaz, warm lighting, calm music bed)*

Hi there — and welcome to the **Retiree Business Blueprint.**

[pause 1 s]

If you’re watching this, it means you haven’t stopped dreaming — you’ve just decided to dream smarter.

[pause 1 s]

For some of you, this is about supplementing income.

For others, it’s about purpose, structure, and having a reason to wake up excited again.

[pause 1 s]

Whatever your “why,” this is where you turn it into *something real.*

[pause 2 s]

This first module — **Retirement Reinvented: Setting Up for Success** — is about building a foundation that actually lasts.

We’ll set expectations, prepare your space, and tune your mind for success.

**[Slide Cue 1: Two Paths — Essentials & Mastery (1:00 – 2:10)]**

You have two ways to travel through this course.

**The Essentials track** — a 7-day crash course that takes about 10 hours total.

Perfect if you want momentum right away.

**The Mastery track** — the complete 8-week program with five lessons a week and two catch-up days built in.

It’s the deep dive that turns ideas into income.

[pause 1 s]

Here’s the promise:

Give us  **one hour a day** , and we’ll help you build a business you can actually run — without burning out.

[pause 2 s]

You’ll learn step by step, and every lesson ends with action.

You won’t just learn concepts — you’ll get stuff done.

[pause 1 s]

Take a second right now to look at your week.

When are you most alert? When do you have quiet time?

Mark that hour on your calendar — same time each day if you can.

That’s your **Business Hour.**

[pause 2 s]

**[Slide Cue 2: Prepare Your Workspace (2:10 – 3:30)]**

Now, let’s set you up for success.

Find a spot that feels comfortable and yours.

It could be the kitchen table, a desk, or a corner of your living room — any place you can claim for thinking and writing.

[pause 1 s]

Gather what you need:

a journal or notebook, pens, your printed worksheets, and a few recent bills or bank statements you’ll use later when we talk about money.

[pause 1 s]

Make the space inviting.

Add your favorite coffee mug or a photo that reminds you why you’re doing this.

And try this — keep a **“Success Jar.”**

Every time you finish a lesson, jot down one thing you learned or one action you took.

Drop it in the jar.

By the end of this course, you’ll see how far you’ve come.

[pause 2 s]

**[Slide Cue 3: Mindset Matters (3:30 – 4:45)]**

Starting a business at this stage is about mindset as much as methods.

[pause 1 s]

Some folks ask, “Isn’t it too late for me to start?”

The answer is simple: **No. Not if you’re breathing and curious.**

[pause 1 s]

Your advantage is experience.

You’ve been tested by life — work, family, crisis, change.

That means you’ve already done the hard stuff most younger entrepreneurs haven’t.

[pause 1 s]

This course helps you re-wire that experience into momentum.

So when you hit a bump — a tech issue, a self-doubt moment — remember: it’s built in.

We expect it.

And we support you through it.

[pause 2 s]

Stick a note on your wall that says, *“I’m capable of building my dream business.”*

Read it out loud when you sit down.

Small rituals create big results.

[pause 1 s]

**[Slide Cue 4: Your Support Network (4:45 – 5:40)]**

You’re not doing this alone.

[pause 1 s]

If you need help at any point, reach out through our **Tech Concierge.**

That’s real people, not bots — ready to walk you through anything from downloading a worksheet to setting up your first website.

[pause 1 s]

We also run **Live Setup Labs** during the first few weeks of the program.

They’re hands-on sessions for WordPress, email, and payment setup.

Don’t miss them — they’re your fastest path to confidence.

[pause 1 s]

And inside our private group, you’ll find other students posting wins, asking questions, and cheering each other on.

Jump in.

Say hello.

You’ll feel part of something bigger right away.

[pause 2 s]

**[Slide Cue 5: Readiness Quiz & Next Steps (5:40 – 6:50)]**

Before you move on to Module 1,

take the **Readiness Quiz.**

It’s not a test — it’s a mirror.

[pause 1 s]

Your results will show where you’re strong and where to focus next.

If you’re “ready to launch,” you’ll jump right into planning.

If you’re “cautious but capable,” we’ll walk with you through guardrails and risk-management.

And if you’re “preparing to begin,” we’ll start by strengthening your foundation.

[pause 2 s]

When you finish, download your free **5-Day Starter Plan** and the  **10 Business Ideas Guide** .

Those two resources will help you see what’s possible right away — no guesswork, no pressure.

[pause 1 s]

Then post in the group one sentence:

*“I’ve started — here’s my goal for the week.”*

It might be as simple as printing your worksheets or clearing your desk.

But saying it out loud makes it real.

[pause 2 s]

**[Slide Cue 6: Closing & Motivation (6:50 – 7:40)]**

Let me leave you with this:

This course is not about hustle.

It’s about direction.

It’s not about re-learning everything from scratch.

It’s about re-discovering what’s already inside you — and using it smarter this time.

[pause 2 s]

You have decades of skills and stories that still matter.

We’re just going to help you package them into something that creates freedom, purpose, and a bit of income on the side.

[pause 2 s]

So take a deep breath,

pour yourself a coffee,

and click into Lesson 0.1.

You’re not starting over.

You’re just starting *smarter.*

[pause 2 s]

**Welcome to the Retiree Business Blueprint.**

Let’s begin.
