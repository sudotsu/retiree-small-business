# SAP Launch Email Set (v1)

## Email 1 – Launch

This is a placeholder launch email. We don’t yet have the marketing hooks needed to craft the message. Once the hooks are available, this email will introduce the Second Act Profit System, highlight the big promise, and encourage readers to visit the landing page.

## Email 2 – Objection-Killer

This is a placeholder objection-killer email. Without the hooks, we cannot address specific objections. Eventually this email will tackle common hesitations and emphasize the benefits of the program.

## Email 3 – Last Call

This is a placeholder last-call email. When we have the hooks, this email will create urgency, remind readers of the offer, and compel them to act before the opportunity closes.
