## Write Your Intent Statement

**Take 10 minutes to answer these questions in your workbook:**

1. **What's one reason this matters now** (not "someday")?
   - Example: "I want to supplement my retirement income while I'm still healthy enough to work."

2. **Where will the hour-a-day fit in your week?** Be specific (days and times).
   - Example: "Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings from 9-10am, after my morning walk."

3. **Who's one supportive person** you'll tell this week, and what will you ask of them?
   - Example: "My daughter Sarah—I'll ask her to check in with me every Friday to see my progress."

4. **What's a no-cost, 20-minute action** you could take in the next 48 hours?
   - Example: "Call three local businesses similar to what I want to do and ask what they wish they'd known when starting."

5. **What's your comfort limit** for start-up cash this month? (Write a number)
   - Example: "$200"

6. **What would "a good month" look like three months from now?** (1-2 sentences)
   - Example: "I'll have talked to 10 potential customers, validated my idea, and made my first $100 in sales."

### Create Your Intent Statement

**Write your 2-sentence commitment:**

"I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will [your action] by [date]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will sell crafts locally by December 10."
- "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will sell five knitted scarves in December by the 10th."
- "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will pre-sell 5 scarves at $25 each by December 10 via church bulletin."

**Activity:** Write your Intent Statement on the Intent Card in your workbook. If you're comfortable, read it aloud or share it with your accountability buddy.

## Block Time on Your Calendar

**Schedule two 60-minute study sessions this week:**
- Session 1: [Your day/time] - Complete Module 1, Lesson 1.1

**Why this matters:** Two hours blocked beats "someday"—and it compounds. Momentum beats perfection.
