## Lesson 0.4: Intent Statement, Guided Reflection, and Tiny Commitment

**Time: 20 minutes**

### Guided Reflection

**Take 10 minutes to write your answers to these prompts in your workbook:**

1. **What's one reason this matters now** (not "someday")?

   - Example: "I want to supplement my retirement income while I'm still healthy enough to work."

2. **Where will the hour-a-day fit in your week?** Be specific (days/times).

   - Example: "Monday, Wednesday, Friday mornings from 9-10am, after my morning walk."

3. **Who's one supportive person** you'll tell this week, and what will you ask of them?

   - Example: "My daughter Sarah—I'll ask her to check in with me every Friday to see my progress."

4. **What's a no-cost, 20-minute action** you could take in the next 48 hours?

   - Example: "Call three local businesses similar to what I want to do and ask what they wish they'd known when starting."

5. **What's your comfort limit** for start-up cash this month? (Write a number)

   - Example: "$200"

6. **What would "a good month" look like three months from now?** (1-2 sentences)
   - Example: "I'll have talked to 10 potential customers, validated my idea, and made my first $100 in sales."

### Intent Statement

**Write your 2-sentence Intent Statement:**

"I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will [micro-action] by [date]."

**Examples:**

- _Good:_ "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will sell crafts locally by December 10."
- _Better:_ "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will sell five knitted scarves in December by the 10th."
- _Best:_ "I'm exploring a small, low-risk business that fits my life. This week I will pre-sell 5 scarves at $25 each by December 10 via church bulletin."

**Activity:** Write your Intent Statement on the Intent Card in your workbook (tear-off format). If you're comfortable, read it aloud or share it with your accountability buddy.

### Calendar Commitment

**Block two 60-minute study sessions this week:**

- Session 1: [Your chosen day/time] - Complete Module 1, Lesson 1.1
- Session 2: [Your chosen day/time] - Complete Module 1, Lesson 1.2

**Why this matters:** Two hours blocked beats "someday"—and it compounds. Momentum beats perfection.

**Activity:** Open your calendar (phone or paper) and add these two blocks now. Set a reminder.

### Optional: Accountability Buddy Check-In

If you opted in for a buddy:

- Exchange phone numbers or forum contact info
- Schedule a 10-minute check-in next week
