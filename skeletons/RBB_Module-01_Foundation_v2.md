# Module 01 — **Default Settings → Fit Check (Go/No‑Go)**

[TAG:Module01] · **Time** : ~5 hours total (5 × ~60 min) · **Mode** : self‑paced + optional live lab

**Why this module exists (no fluff):** if a learner’s _attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and people_ don’t support a business, pushing them into tactics is malpractice. This module gets a clear read, refines what needs refining, and makes a hard call: proceed, proceed with guardrails, or pause. This aligns 1:1 with the “Week One” sequence in Mastery and keeps a bridge to Essentials for time‑boxed learners. Korb weeks 1-4 marketing/RBB_Marketing-Hooks_Master_v1.md

## Learning outcomes (assessed)

By the end of M1, the learner will:

1. Surface the 3 dominant influences in their decision‑making (L1.1). Korb weeks 1-4
2. Document current **default settings** across attitudes, beliefs, motivations, people (L1.2). Korb weeks 1-4
3. Analyze positives/negatives of those defaults and align to one of four business “styles” (consulting, creative/maker, service, digital) to shortlist ideas (L1.3). Korb weeks 1-4

4. Refine defaults and set guardrails (support, risk limits, time boundaries) (L1.4). Korb weeks 1-4
5. Make an explicit **Go / Guardrails / Not‑Yet** decision and lock next steps (L1.5). Korb weeks 1-4

**Adult‑learning (andragogy) guardrails we honor:** start with their lived experience, make it problem‑centered, keep tech low‑friction, deliver immediate application, and respect pace options (hour‑a‑day Mastery vs. 10‑hour Essentials). KORB ESSENTIALS

## Lesson Scripts (for learners; 5 x ~60 minutes)

### L1.1 — What actually drives my decisions? (60 min)

**Hook (2–3 min):** Quick “admits only” check: _Are you wired for entrepreneurship?_ Take **Quiz 1 – Are You Wired for Entrepreneurship?** and tag outcome automatically.

**Pathing by result:**

- Mostly A’s → tag `quiz1_ready_to_launch` → you’re cleared to press on.
- Mostly B’s → tag `quiz1_cautious_capable` → keep going, but you’ll set extra guardrails.
- Mostly C’s → tag `quiz1_build_confidence` → continue this module + you’ll be offered an Essentials shortcut later. quizzes_and_emails
- Mostly C’s → tag `quiz1_build_confidence` → continue this module + you’ll be offered an Essentials shortcut later. assessments/quizzes_and_emails.md

**Exercise (core, from Mastery W1 D1):** _What Drives My Decisions_ — 3‑minute brain‑dump (≥21 influences), prune 5 least, select 7 most, then circle top 3. Journal what those top 3 reveal about your “wiring.” (Workbook page provided below.) Korb weeks 1-4

**Talk track (why this matters):** your top‑3 influences are the “pressure defaults” that show up when business gets real; we’ll use them to design supports, not to psychoanalyze. Korb weeks 1-4

### L1.2 — Inventory my default settings (attitudes, beliefs, motivations, people) (60 min)

**Exercise (from Mastery W1 D2):** _My Default Settings_ — list 5 attitudes, 5 beliefs, 5 motivations, ≥5 people who meaningfully shape you—especially under pressure. Journal what’s visible vs. hidden to others. Korb weeks 1-4

**Lead‑gen primer inside the “People” list:** flag 3 supporters who could be early referrers; this seeds the later “word‑of‑mouth first” strategy emphasized in Week 6. (Note: for retirees, referrals are the cheapest channel—on purpose.) Korb weeks 5-8

### L1.3 — Positives & negatives → align to business “style,” shortlist 2–3 ideas (60–75 min)

**Exercise (from Mastery W1 D3):** for each of the four categories (attitudes, beliefs, motivations, people), list ≥3 positives and ≥3 negatives. Identify your top 2 helps and top 2 hindrances. Korb weeks 1-4

**Style fit + ideas (marketing asset integration):** take **Quiz 2 – What’s Your Perfect Retiree Business Style?** Outcomes map to four lanes: Consulting Champion, Creative Maker, Service Star, Digital Producer. Then open **“10 Business Ideas Perfect for Retirees”** and compare startup cost, weekly hours, tech level, physical demand, regulation load—pick **2–3 candidates** that match your realities. quizzes_and_emails

### L1.4 — Refine defaults + set guardrails (time, risk, support, tech) (60 min)

**Exercise (from Mastery W1 D4):** _Refining My Default Settings_ — rewrite each list as you _want it to be_ ; star items that changed. Capture _reasons_ behind changes and the expected positives/negatives. Korb weeks 1-4

**Guardrails setup (marketing asset integration):**

- **Time** : if you’re going Mastery, commit to **“hour‑a‑day”** ; if you’re time‑constrained, opt into the **Essentials 10‑hour pathway** as an approved alternate pace (we’re not here to break people). KORB ESSENTIALS
- **Risk** : define “max cash-at‑risk per month” for 90 days.
- **Support** : nominate 2 “cheerleaders” from your People list and 1 “accountability partner.”
- **Tech** : take **Quiz 5 – Tech Comfort** ; if “Hands‑On Helper,” we bias your near‑term lead gen toward low‑tech channels while we scaffold basics. If “Digital Pioneer,” we’ll let you move faster online. Email #1 variants pre‑written. quizzes_and_emails

**Exercise (from Mastery W1 D5):** _Will My Default Settings Support My Business?_ Answer the four core questions (attitudes, beliefs, motivations, people) and write the call. Be blunt. Better to stop now than to sink money/time. Korb weeks 1-4

**Decision gates (with pre‑wired automations):**

- **GO** — Tag `m1_go`. You’ll enter W2 (Big Picture) and receive the **5‑Day Starter Plan** as a momentum bonus. marketing-assets-1

## Assessment & evidence (what we collect, and why)

- **Required uploads:** Decision Drivers Card, Defaults v1, Pos/Neg grid, Idea Shortlist, Defaults v2 + Guardrails, Fit Check decision.
- **Criteria:** completeness, internal consistency (e.g., guardrails reflect time and risk realities), decision clarity.
- **Pass threshold to proceed:** a documented decision (Go/Guardrails/Not‑Yet) + idea shortlist (if Go/Guardrails). (Competitor programs emphasize step‑by‑step clarity, community accountability; this matches that best practice.) Comprehensive*Analysis* Perplex…

## Notes on parity with Essentials

Learners who can’t sustain hour‑a‑day pacing can **toggle to Essentials** without stigma (we call it “same destination, condensed path”). Essentials explicitly lets them complete core vitals in ~10 hours with the same pillars (defaults → big picture → time → marketing → money → customers → consolidation). We keep outcomes consistent across tracks to avoid whiplash. KORB ESSENTIALS

## Authoring baseline used

This module intentionally mirrors **Mastery Week One** structure (Days 1–5: decision drivers → define defaults → positives/negatives → refine → business fit) so learners always know what’s next and why. Korb weeks 1-4

### (Optional) Landing‑page copy snippets to promote Module 1

- **Angle:** “Make the call in five honest hours.”
- **Subhead:** “If the fit isn’t there, we show you a safer path. If it is, you’ll hit Week Two with momentum.”
- **Credibility:** emphasize age‑appropriate pace + community + low‑risk models (values seen across leading peer programs)
