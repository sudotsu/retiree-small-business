# Module 00 — Start Here: Orientation & First Wins
[TAG:Module00]

**Short Summary (from Authoritative Map):**
A gentle, practical on‑ramp: meet your support team, confirm the “hour‑a‑day” rhythm, take a short readiness quiz, write a 2‑sentence intent statement, and make your first tiny commitment. You’ll leave with your route (5‑Day Starter Plan), an optional ideas list, and a human you can contact when stuck. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Lesson Scripts

### L0.1 — Welcome, How to Get Help, and Tech‑Light Promise (20 min)

**Instructor talking points (scripted):**

- “Welcome to Retiree Business Blueprint. This is not a ‘hustle’ class; it’s **steady, one hour a day**.”
- **Support, right up front (show slide):**
  - **Email:** support@retireebusinessblueprint.com (replace with live address)
  - **Call/Text:** (xxx) xxx‑xxxx (business hours, replace with live number)
  - **Office Hours:** Tue & Thu, 2–3 pm local time (Zoom and Phone‑in)
  - **1‑Click ‘Get Help’** button inside the course (routes to a human inbox)
  - **Printable Quick‑Start:** “Where to click, who to call, what to do first” (handout)
- **Tech‑Light Promise:** No new logins beyond the course. Everything works on phone or printouts.
- **What we’ll do today:** quick tour → readiness quiz → intent statement → pick your Day‑1 action.
  _(Note to instructor: read the support panel aloud; do a 30‑sec demo of where to click.)_ :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**Micro‑activity (2 min):** Learners write down the support email/phone on the first workbook page (“Support Cheat Sheet”) and bookmark it. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

### L0.2 — Tour the Course & Join the Community (20 min)

**Scripted tour:**

- **Essentials (7‑day crash):** for momentum and quick wins.
- **Mastery (8 weeks / 9 modules):** deeper build (default settings → marketing → money → customers → action plan). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- Show exactly **where the “Ask for Help” lives** in the interface, and where to download printables.
- **Community norms (read):** Kind, practical, no jargon. Prefer **phone or forum?** Both are fine.

**Peer interaction (low‑tech):**

- **Hello Post (5 min):** “Name, city, 1 skill you bring, 1 thing you hope to get.”
- **Buddy Opt‑In:** Sign a one‑line card: “I’d like a check‑in buddy.” Staff pairs people within 48 hours (or put out a pairing thread). Provide **phone-first** option.
  _(Instructor cue: model a great 2‑sentence intro.)_ :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

### L0.3 — Readiness Quiz → Personal Route & First Next Step (30 min)

**Tool:** **Quiz 3 – Your Small Business Readiness Score** (kept exactly as authored; tags preserved: `quiz3_ready_to_launch`, `quiz3_cautious_capable`, `quiz3_preparing_to_begin`). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

**Flow:**

1. Learners take the 6–7 minute quiz (paper or on‑screen; large‑print available).
2. Instructor shows the **three outcomes** slide and reads the matching “Next Step” from the quiz asset:
   - **Ready to Launch →** go straight to **Day 5 – First Step Forward** + **Launch Action Items** checklist.
   - **Cautious but Capable →** **Day 3 – Plan Small, Dream Smart** + **Time Plan** checklist.
   - **Preparing to Begin →** **Day 1 – Discover Your Business Spark** + **Personal Readiness** checklist.
     (These map to the **Free 5‑Day Starter Plan** handout.) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
3. Learners circle their outcome on the workbook page and write **one micro‑task** to do within 48 hours.

**Email follow‑up:** Trigger the outcome‑specific Email #1 from the quiz pack (same copy; send inside your ESP). :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

### L0.4 — Intent Statement, Guided Reflection, and Tiny Commitment (20 min)

**Guided reflection prompts (write in workbook):**

- What’s **one reason** this matters now (not “someday”)?
- Where will the **hour‑a‑day** fit in your week? Be specific (days/times).
- Who’s **one supportive person** you’ll tell this week, and what will you ask of them?
- What’s a **no‑cost, 20‑minute** action you could take in the next 48 hours?
- What’s your **comfort limit** for start‑up cash this month (a number)?
- What would “a good month” look like three months from now (1–2 sentences)?
  _(These map directly to Essentials’ time, readiness, and objectives flow.)_ :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

**Intent statement (2 sentences, read aloud if comfortable):**
“I’m exploring a small, low‑risk business that fits my life. This week I will [micro‑action] by [date].”

**Buddy prompt (optional):** Exchange phone numbers, schedule a **10‑minute** check‑in next week.

## Instructor Guide (pointers)

- **Before class:** Print Support Cheat Sheet, Reflection, Intent, Buddy cards. Open community “Hello Post” thread. Test phone‑in line for office hours.
- **Timing:** L0.1 (20) / L0.2 (20) / L0.3 (30) / L0.4 (20).
- **Accessibility:** Always offer “read aloud,” large‑print PDFs, and phone alternatives.
- **Low‑tech pairing:** If someone won’t use the forum, pair **phone‑to‑phone**.
- **Email automation:** After L0.3, send the matching **Readiness Email #1** from the quiz pack (copy already written). Tag the contact per quiz outcome (for future personalization). :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
- **No AI tools.** All demos use checklists, templates, and human office hours only.

## 7‑Step Validation (Transclusion)

<!-- Transclude or reference the single source checklist below -->

<!-- include: ./../SAP_7-Step-Validation_v1.md -->

<!-- Instructor note: In Module 0, confirm accessibility (fonts/printables), outcome mapping (Day 1/3/5 routes), and “export readiness” (printable intent card). -->

Why this nails the three priorities

Support, early and loud. It’s the second sentence of the module and the biggest slide block. We force the bookmark/write‑down moment and provide a print sheet so no one gets stuck when the screen feels scary.

skeletons/RBB_Module-00_Welcome-And-Setup_v2.md

Peer connection without tech sprawl. A single “hello” thread, a buddy opt‑in, and an optional phone chat create accountability without adding tools. This drives retention—especially with retirees—without overwhelming them.

skeletons/RBB_Module-00_Welcome-And-Setup_v2.md

Guided reflection that leads to action. The prompts are specific and map straight into the 5‑Day Starter Plan routes and Essentials flow (time, readiness, first steps). That turns “thinking” into doing within 48 hours.

marketing/RBB_Marketing-Hooks_Master_v1.md

KORB ESSENTIALS

AI removed. No bots, no “smart” widgets, no techno‑magic. Just humans, templates, printables, and schedules (plus the quizzes and lead magnets you already authored).

## Short Summary (from Authoritative Map)

Set expectations; remove tech friction; earn a day‑zero win. You’ll configure your learning setup, take a no‑pressure readiness quiz, and commit two calendar blocks so Week 1 lands. (See also Module 0 outline & assets in the course draft and marketing pack for this module’s ad hooks and lead magnet ties.)

## Lesson Plan (by lesson)

1. **L0.1 — Orientation & Choosing Your Track** — objective(s): MO1, MO3; time: 25m (watch 10, do 15)

   - **Key ideas:** What the course covers; Mastery (8 weeks, 5 sessions/wk, 2 catch‑up days) vs. Essentials (7‑day crash course). “Give us an hour a day…” Expectations: action > theory; worksheets are printable & fillable.
   - **Activity:** Pick your track; block two sessions on your calendar this week; identify a support person.
   - **Retrieval check (2 Qs):**
     1. Which track are you selecting and why?
     2. Name one way we’ll keep “action first” in this program.

2. **L0.2 — Tech, Accessibility & Community Setup** — objective(s): MO1; time: 35m

   - **Key ideas:** Logging into the portal; downloading the workbook; caption & transcript toggles; large‑print PDFs; how to get help.
   - **Activity:** Complete the Tech Setup Checklist; post a hello in the cohort thread.
   - **Retrieval check (2 Qs):**
     1. Which accessibility setting did you enable?
     2. Where do you post a question if you’re stuck?

3. **L0.3 — Quick Win: Readiness Quiz + Intent** — objective(s): MO2, MO3; time: 30m

   - **Key ideas:** This quiz is a mirror, not a verdict; outcomes map to next actions (Ready/Cautious/Build‑Confidence).
   - **Activity:** Take **Quiz 0 — Are You Wired for Entrepreneurship?** Then draft your one‑sentence Intent and upload your Orientation Pack.
   - **Retrieval check (2 Qs):** quizzes_and_emails
   - **Retrieval check (2 Qs):** assessments/quizzes_and_emails.md
     1. What did your quiz outcome suggest you do next?

## Instructor Guide

- **Personas:**
  - Tech‑anxious retiree; Confident but cautious planner; Eager launcher.
- **Likely blockers & brief scripts:**
  - _“I’m not techy.”_ → “You only need three clicks today; we’ll do them together. If it breaks, we fix it.”
  - _“I’m busy.”_ → “Two hours blocked beats ‘someday’—and it compounds.”
  - _“What if I’m not cut out for this?”_ → “That’s what the quiz clarifies. All outcomes include a next step.”
- **Good/Better/Best exemplars:**
  - One‑sentence Intent: _Good:_ “Sell crafts locally.” _Better:_ “Sell five knitted scarves in December.” _Best:_ “Pre‑sell 5 scarves @ $25 each by Dec 10 via church bulletin.”
- **Timing cues & adaptations:** keep L0.1 ≤12m; pause after each click in setup; invite one share before moving on.
- **Escalation path:** Tech ticket → Concierge call → As‑needed 1:1 screenshare (15 min slots).
