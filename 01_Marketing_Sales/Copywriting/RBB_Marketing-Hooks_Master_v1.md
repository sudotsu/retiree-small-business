**Program:** Retiree Business Blueprint (Essentials 7‑Day + Mastery 8‑Week)

**Owner:** A.J. / RetireeBusinessBlueprint.com

**Purpose:** Central library of audience‑tested hooks, angles, and copy blocks for ads, emails, landing pages, webinars, and print.

**Version:** v1 (comprehensive refresh) • **Last updated:** 2025‑11‑04

---

## 0) Positioning Pillars (what every hook must reinforce)

1. **Age = Advantage.** We celebrate experience, credibility, and networks; we reject hustle‑culture posturing. Community > competition. Comprehensive*Analysis* Perplex…
2. **Low‑risk, flexible path.** Pace, cohort support, and weekly drip are by design; they reduce overwhelm and raise completion. Comprehensive*Analysis* Perplex…
3. **Two clear tracks.** 10‑hour **Essentials** (7‑Day) and 8‑week **Mastery** (9 modules) with practical exercises tied to real‑world action. Master_Index_v2.md
4. **Lead with value.** Free 5‑Day Starter Plan + diagnostic quizzes as the front door.

Tone rules: respectful, straight‑talk, no condescension, no tech‑jargon traps. (“Working smarter, not harder” beats “grind.”) Comprehensive*Analysis* Perplex…
